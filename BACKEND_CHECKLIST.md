# Backend Development Checklist

This checklist will guide the development of a robust, production-ready backend for your application, ensuring all frontend components are fully supported, and the system is ready for deployment on Vercel. The stack includes Next.js (React TS), Supabase, Vercel, and Rust Solana SDK for blockchain integrations.

---

## 1. Project Setup
- [ ] **Monorepo/Directory Structure**: Organize backend and frontend code for clarity (e.g., `/api`, `/blockchain`, `/lib`, `/prisma` if using ORM).
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Securely manage secrets (Supabase keys, Solana RPC endpoints, etc.) using `.env` and Vercel dashboard.
- [ ] **TypeScript Configuration**: Ensure strict type checking for all backend code.
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up GitHub Actions for linting, testing, and deployment to Vercel.

## 2. API Design & Implementation
- [ ] **REST/GraphQL Endpoints**: Define endpoints for all major features:
  - User authentication (login, signup, profile)
  - Campaigns (CRUD, flow, details)
  - Content collection (CRUD)
  - Social accounts (integration, CRUD)
  - Scheduling (calendar, reminders)
  - Law of Attraction (form submission, analysis, results)
  - Blog, Careers, Support, Documentation (content fetch)
- [ ] **API Validation**: Use Zod or similar for request/response validation.
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Standardize error responses and logging.
- [ ] **Rate Limiting & Security**: Protect endpoints from abuse.

## 3. Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] **Supabase Auth Integration**: Email/password, OAuth, and session management.
- [ ] **Role-Based Access Control**: Protect sensitive endpoints (admin, user, guest roles).
- [ ] **JWT/Session Validation**: Secure API and SSR/ISR routes.

## 4. Database & Storage
- [ ] **Supabase Database Schema**: Design tables for users, campaigns, content, schedules, social accounts, etc.
- [ ] **Migrations**: Use Supabase CLI for schema migrations.
- [ ] **File Storage**: Integrate Supabase Storage for user uploads (avatars, campaign assets).
- [ ] **Data Seeding**: Seed initial data for development/testing.

## 5. Blockchain Integration (Rust Solana SDK)
- [ ] **Rust Microservice**: Build a Rust service for Solana blockchain interactions (deployed as a serverless function or microservice).
- [ ] **API Bridge**: Expose blockchain actions (e.g., campaign tokenization, on-chain analytics) via secure API endpoints.
- [ ] **Wallet Integration**: Support wallet connect, transaction signing, and on-chain data fetch for users.
- [ ] **Testing**: Unit and integration tests for all blockchain logic.

## 6. Feature Logic (per Frontend Component)
- [ ] **Profile**: CRUD for user profile, avatar upload, edit/save logic, success feedback.
- [ ] **Settings**: Password change, preferences, notification settings.
- [ ] **Campaigns**: Create, edit, delete, view details, manage flow (nodes, triggers, actions), analytics.
- [ ] **Content Collection**: CRUD for content items, bulk actions, search/filter.
- [ ] **Social Accounts**: OAuth integration, connect/disconnect, fetch social data.
- [ ] **Schedule**: Calendar data, reminders, event CRUD, time zone support.
- [ ] **Law of Attraction**: Form submission, server-side analysis, result storage and retrieval.
- [ ] **Blog/Careers/Support/Documentation**: Fetch and render content from database or CMS.

## 7. Realtime & Notifications
- [ ] **Supabase Realtime**: Listen for changes (e.g., campaign updates, new content).
- [ ] **Email/Push Notifications**: Integrate with Supabase or third-party service for transactional emails and push notifications.

## 8. Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] **Unit & Integration Tests**: For all API endpoints and blockchain logic.
- [ ] **End-to-End Tests**: Use Playwright or Cypress for user flows.
- [ ] **Type Safety**: Ensure end-to-end type safety between backend and frontend (e.g., tRPC, OpenAPI, or custom types).

## 9. Production Readiness
- [ ] **Logging & Monitoring**: Integrate with Vercel Analytics, Sentry, or similar.
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Use serverless best practices, cache where appropriate.
- [ ] **Error Tracking**: Centralized error reporting for backend and blockchain services.
- [ ] **Security Audit**: Review for XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, and blockchain-specific vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Documentation**: API docs (OpenAPI/Swagger), onboarding guides, and runbooks.

## 10. Deployment
- [ ] **Vercel Deployment**: Ensure successful build and deployment from GitHub main branch.
- [ ] **Environment Variables on Vercel**: Set all required secrets in Vercel dashboard.
- [ ] **Production Database & Blockchain Endpoints**: Point to production Supabase and Solana endpoints.
- [ ] **Post-Deployment Smoke Test**: Verify all major features work in production.
